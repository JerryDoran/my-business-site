              Welcome to my corner of the web! I&apos;m Jerry and I specialize
              in creating awesome and affordable websites and web applications
              for small to medium size businesses. My mission is to build sites
              that are not only effective and user-friendly but also beautiful -
              the kind your customers will love.

              Here are some common web design practices that can really annoy
              users:

            <ul className="prose prose-invert mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              <li>Autoplaying sliders</li>
              <li>Autoplaying sound</li>
              <li>Animations that take over your mouse scrolling</li>
              <li>Menus hidden behind buttons</li>
              <li>Important content hidden behind carousels/sliders</li>
              <li>Long animations</li>
              <li>Slow page loads and refreshes</li>

              Many developers make these mistakes trying to be unique or
              memorable but you don&apos;t have to sacrifice user experience to
              stand out. Websites can be both user friendly and beautifully
              designed.

            <p className="prose prose-invert mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              I started asking myself questions like &quot;What makes a good
              website?&quot; and &quot;What do users really care about?&quot; By
              answering these questions I learned what makes websites work well
              and where they can often go wrong. This helps me create better
              websites for my customers.

              I&apos;m passionate about helping small businesses thrive online
              by creating high-quality, affordable websites. I believe every
              business, no matter the size, deserves a site that not only looks
              great but also works hard for themâ€”without breaking the bank. My
              goal is to make sure your website reflects your unique brand and
              helps you grow, all while keeping things budget-friendly.
