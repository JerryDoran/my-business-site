          Welcome to my corner of the web! I&apos;m Jerry and I specialize in
          creating awesome and affordable websites and web applications for
          small to medium size businesses. My mission is to build sites that are
          not only effective and user-friendly but also beautiful - the kind
          your customers will love.
        </p>

          Here are some common web design practices that can really annoy users:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Autoplaying sliders</li>
          <li>Autoplaying sound</li>
          <li>Animations that take over your mouse scrolling</li>
          <li>Menus hidden behind buttons</li>
          <li>Important content hidden behind carousels/sliders</li>
          <li>Long animations</li>
          <li>Slow page loads and refreshes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many developers make these mistakes trying to be unique or memorable
          but you don&apos;t have to sacrifice user experience to stand out.
          Websites can be both user friendly and beautifully designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started asking myself questions like &quot;What makes a good
          website?&quot; and &quot;What do users really care about?&quot; By
          answering these questions I learned what makes websites work well and
          where they can often go wrong. This helps me create better websites
          for my customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m passionate about helping small businesses thrive online by
          creating high-quality, affordable websites. I believe every business,
          no matter the size, deserves a site that not only looks great but also
          works hard for themâ€”without breaking the bank. My goal is to make sure
          your website reflects your unique brand and helps you grow, all while
          keeping things budget-friendly.
